# Supro. project by Fagru Team

## What's Supro. projet ?

This projet is a challenge given to learners @BeCode WebDev Formation.

It consists to reproduce the design and some features of a real online website with a mini webshop.

The challenge is to reproduce 5 pages from PNG files and somes instructions for desktop, mobile or tablet use.

## Technologies used

For this projet, all ressources learned can be used so, we used them.

* ### HTML

For the structure and SEO optimisation of the pages.

* ### CSS 

For the styling page and structured grid / flex.

* ### SASS 

To make CSS more easier (variables and includes usage).

* ### JS and Jquery

On some stuff to have some things functionnal (Countdown on the main page and Burger menu for responsive design).

## Organisation

* ### Fabian Quoidbach 

He was the lead of this project but he doesn't like giving too many orders so we worked without a leader.

He was in charge of the Homepage (Desktop / Tablet and Mobile Structure and styling).

The Product page (Desktop / Tablet and Mobile structure and styling) was realised on extra-time.

* ### Ruben Lomo Maestu 

He was in charge of the Shop page (Desktop / Tablet and Mobile Structure and Styling).

* ### Gregory Di Caro 

He was in charge of the Contact page (Desktop / Tablet and Mobile Structure and Styling)

## Result

At the beginning, it was difficult to organize work properly, but finally, we are proud to show you what we have done in one week.
